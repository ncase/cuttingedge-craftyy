# Craftyy: An in-browser HTML5 game creation tool

The newest version of Craftyy is online at [labs.craftyy.com](http://labs.craftyy.com), which allows you to create an account and save games.
Note that this git repo has these server-dependent features removed.

Craftyy is currently in alpha. I'll be making significant improvements to the library, plus adding samples and documentation.
Please be aware that this may necessitate changes to the existing API.

## Running Craftyy Locally with MAMP
1. Open MAMP
2. In Preferences > Apache, set the document root to this repo.
3. That's it. It's now running on localhost!

## License
Craftyy is released freely under the MIT license, which means you can use it for pretty much anything. (including commercial projects)
Credit's always appreciated, but it is not a requirement. Speaking of giving credit...
